## Blue Squares
To solve a quick Desmos activity, where you have to turn a 5x5 white board of squares blue. Every time you click on a square, it toggles it and its direct horizontal, vertical, but not diagonal neighbors between white and blue.
Notice the order does not matter, and toggling a square more than twice in any order is meaningless. Therefore, a solution can be decided in less than or equal to 25 total moves, with each move being different and in no particular order.
I wrote a quick JS program to bash it out, so yeah. Pretty simple.
