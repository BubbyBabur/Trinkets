## Trinkets
Random stuff I do, thought I'd save to Github so once my computer inevitably commits seppuku I'll still be able to access my poorly written programs and cry over my miniscule progress.

*Edit: My computer actually did decide to commit seppuku, and I lost basically everything if not for Github.
