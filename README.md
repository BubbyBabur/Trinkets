## Trinkets
Random stuff I do, thought I'd save to Github so once my computer inevitably commits seppuku I'll still be able to access my poorly written programs and cry over my miniscule progress.

I can program in HTML/JS/CSS, Java, Python, and a little bit of C++. From what I can tell, C++ and Java are boomers, Javascript is that one really rebellious child, C# really wants to impress its parents while trying to stay up to date with the zoomers, and Python is that quirky uwu not like the other girls kind of programming language.
